The analysis of customer reviews constitutes a fundamental strategic practice in the contemporary business context, as it enables the extraction of valuable insights regarding customer satisfaction, product quality perception, and the identification of areas requiring improvement.

Furthermore, the systematic study of these reviews can assist in detecting emerging trends, anticipating market demands, and proactively addressing potential issues, thereby fostering a more personalized and effective relationship with the target audience. Ultimately, such actions contribute not only to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty but also to the maximization of the company's competitiveness and profitability in the market.
